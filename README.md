## Agile Methodologies - Project Management

Fit&Fine utilizes Agile project management to ensure iterative development and continuous improvement. GitHub Projects is used to manage tasks and track progress using a Kanban-style board.

### Story Points Allocation

**Story Points Distribution:**
Story points were allocated to each user story to measure the effort and complexity involved. These points aid in estimating the workload and prioritizing tasks effectively.

**Allocation Guidelines:**
- **Must-have Stories**: Essential features critical to the project's operations were assigned the highest priority.
- **Should-have Stories**: Important but non-essential features that enhance the user experience without being crucial to core functionality. The total story points for "Should-have" stories did not exceed 60% of the total points in any sprint.
- **Could-have Stories**: Desired features considered only after completing the "Must-have" and "Should-have" categories.

### Sprint Planning 

#### Allocating Story Points to Milestones
We need to distribute the 380 story points across the milestones, ensuring they fit within 6 weeks. We will adjust the story points to match the 6-week timeline.

**Milestone 1: Project Setup and Initial Framework**
- **Total Story Points:** 40 (completed in the first week)
- **Breakdown:**
  - **Must-have:** 24 points
  - **Should-have:** 16 points

**Milestone 2: Core Backend APIs**
- **Total Story Points:** 60 (completed in the first and second weeks)
- **Breakdown:**
  - **Must-have:** 36 points
  - **Should-have:** 24 points

**Milestone 3: Basic User Interface and Functionality**
- **Total Story Points:** 100 (completed in the second and third weeks)
- **Breakdown:**
  - **Must-have:** 60 points
  - **Should-have:** 40 points

**Milestone 4: Advanced Features and Final Integration**
- **Total Story Points:** 130 (completed in the third, fourth, and fifth weeks)
- **Breakdown:**
  - **Must-have:** 52 points
  - **Should-have:** 65 points
  - **Could-have:** 13 points

**Milestone 5: Testing and Bug Fixes**
- **Total Story Points:** 50 (completed in the fifth and sixth weeks)
- **Breakdown:**
  - **Must-have:** 20 points
  - **Should-have:** 25 points
  - **Could-have:** 5 points

### MoSCoW Prioritization

To effectively manage project scope, Fit&Fine implements the MoSCoW prioritization method:

- **Must Haves**: Core functionalities including user registration/login, posting fitness updates, and participating in challenges.
- **Should Haves**: Enhanced features like profile customization, dynamic navigation updates, and filtering challenges.
- **Could Haves**: Additional functionalities such as modifying or deleting comments and creating comprehensive documentation.
- **Won't Haves**: Features not essential for the initial launch, such as third-party advertising.

## Database Schema - Entity Relationship Diagram

I've used [dbdiagram](https://dbdiagram.io/home) to design my site's ERD.

### Database Schema

The Fit&Fine application is structured on a robust database schema designed to facilitate the efficient organization and retrieval of data. Below is an overview of the database schema and the relationships between the different entities.

### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) represents the database schema of Fit&Fine, detailing the system's tables, the data fields within them, and the relationships between the tables.

![ERD of Fit&Fine](documentation/screenshots/erd.png)

### Tables Overview

- **User**: Stores information about the users of the platform, including username, email, and password. The `is_superuser` field indicates whether a user has administrative privileges.

- **Profile**: Contains extended user information such as name, profile image, join date, and other personal details. This table extends the `User` table by associating profiles with user accounts.

- **Challenge**: Central to the application, the `Challenge` table holds data about fitness challenges including title, description, start and end dates, sport type, and the challenge creator (owner).

- **ChallengeParticipant**: Keeps track of which users have joined which challenges. Each record links a user to a specific challenge.

- **DailyRoutine**: Stores data related to users' daily fitness routines, including times for wake-up, meals, workouts, and sleep, as well as additional notes about the user's activities for the day.

- **Post**: Stores posts created by users, including the post content, associated media, creation date, and the user who created the post.

- **Comment**: Enables community interaction by storing comments made by users on posts. Each comment is linked to a specific post and user.

- **Like**: Records likes given by users to posts, tracking which user liked which post.

- **Follower**: Tracks the relationships between users, allowing one user to follow another.

- **About**: Stores static information about the application, such as the company's background, mission statement, and contact details.

- **Collaborate**: Stores user inquiries or messages submitted through the platform's contact form.

### Relationships

- A **one-to-many** relationship exists between `User` and `Challenge`, where one user (as a superuser) can create many challenges.
- A **many-to-many** relationship exists between `User` and `Challenge` through the `ChallengeParticipant` table, allowing multiple users to join multiple challenges.
- A **one-to-many** relationship is set between `Challenge` and `ChallengeParticipant`, where one challenge can have many participants.
- A **one-to-many** relationship exists between `User` and `DailyRoutine`, where one user can have many daily routines.
- A **one-to-many** relationship exists between `User` and `Post`, where one user can create many posts.
- A **one-to-many** relationship exists between `Post` and `Comment`, where one post can have many comments.
- A **one-to-many** relationship exists between `User` and `Comment`, where one user can create many comments.
- A **one-to-many** relationship exists between `Post` and `Like`, where one post can have many likes.
- A **one-to-many** relationship exists between `User` and `Like`, where one user can like many posts.
- A **one-to-many** relationship exists between `User` and `Follower`, where one user can follow many users.
- A **one-to-one** relationship exists between `User` and `Profile`, where each user has one profile.

### Design Considerations

The schema was designed with scalability in mind, ensuring that as the platform grows, new features and data types can be easily incorporated. For example, the separation of the `User` and `Profile` tables allows for flexible user management and the possibility to include additional user attributes in the future without altering the core user authentication system.

## Security

Security is a critical aspect, especially for a platform like Fit&Fine that handles user-generated content and personal data.

### Data Encryption
- All sensitive data, including user passwords and personal information, are encrypted using robust encryption methods to protect against unauthorized access and breaches.

### CSRF Tokens
- CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tokens are included in every form to help authenticate the request with the server when the form is submitted. The absence of these tokens can leave a site vulnerable to attackers who may steal user data.

### Django AllAuth
- Django AllAuth is an installable framework that handles the user registration and authentication process. Authentication is essential to determine when a user is registered or unregistered and to control what content is accessible on Fit&Fine.

### API Security
- The backend uses Django REST framework (DRF) for building the API, with token-based authentication to ensure secure access to the API endpoints.
- Only authenticated users can perform actions like creating posts, joining challenges, and updating profiles.
- Superuser permissions are required for actions like creating, editing, or deleting challenges.

# Deployment

Deploying the Fit&Fine frontend involves using Heroku, a popular cloud platform that enables easy application deployment. Below are the steps for deploying the React frontend of the Fit&Fine application without using the Heroku CLI.

**Prerequisites:**
- A GitHub account
- A Heroku account
- The React application(own version) repository pushed to GitHub or [Fit&Fine React Backend Github Repo](https://github.com/SwathiKeshavamurthy/FitandFine-P5)

**You will need to ensure the value of axios.defaults.baseURL in src/api/axiosDefaults.js is set to the base URL for your API. Pull to your local development environment and push back to GitHub if necessary; otherwise, leave as is to use the original**

## Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Create a Production Build:**

   Before deploying, you need to create a production build of your React application. Run the following command in your local development environment:

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

   This will create a `build` directory with a production build of your app.

2. **Create a New Heroku Application:**

   - Log in to your Heroku account and navigate to the dashboard. Click on "New" and select "Create new app."
   - Enter a unique name for your application and select your region.

3. **Connect GitHub Repository to Heroku:**

  - In your Heroku dashboard, navigate to the "Deploy" tab of your newly created application. Under the "Deployment method" section, select "GitHub."
  - Click on "Connect to GitHub" and authorize Heroku to access your GitHub account. Search for your repository name and connect it.

4. **Enable Automatic Deploys:**

   After connecting your repository, enable automatic deploys by clicking on the "Enable Automatic Deploys" button. This will ensure that every push to your GitHub repository triggers a new deployment on Heroku.

5. **Manual Deployment:**

   To manually deploy your app, scroll down to the "Manual deploy" section, select the branch you want to deploy (typically `main` or `master`), and click "Deploy Branch."

6. **Configure Buildpacks:**

   Heroku automatically detects the buildpack for create-react-app, but if needed, you can add the buildpack manually. Navigate to the "Settings" tab, click "Add buildpack," and select "nodejs."

7. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   If your application uses environment variables, configure them in the Heroku dashboard under the "Settings" tab. Click on "Reveal Config Vars" and add your key-value pairs.

8. **Monitor Deployment:**

   Once the deployment process begins, you can monitor its progress in the "Activity" tab. Heroku will show the build logs and indicate whether the deployment was successful.

9. **Access Your Application:**

   Once the deployment is successful, Heroku will provide a URL to access your application. Click on "Open App" in the Heroku dashboard to view your live site.

## Additional Configurations

**Static Files Serving:**
Ensure your React app is configured to serve static files correctly by setting the appropriate paths in your build configuration.

**Error Handling:**
Make sure your app has proper error handling for production, including custom error pages and logging mechanisms.

**Security:**
Use environment variables for sensitive information and ensure HTTPS is enforced on your Heroku app.

# Acknowledgements

The development of Fit&Fine has been an exciting journey, and I am grateful for the inspiration, guidance, and resources that have contributed to the project. 

## Inspiration
- **Strava**: The idea for Fit&Fine was inspired by [Strava](https://www.strava.com/), a leading platform for fitness enthusiasts to track their activities, compete with others, and share their fitness journeys. Strava's robust features and community-centric approach motivated me to create a similar platform focused on comprehensive fitness tracking and community engagement.

## Project Guidance
**Moments DJANGO REST DRF API and Moments REACT Walkthrough Project** I utilized the Moments Walkthrough Project as a foundational guide. This project provided valuable insights into structuring the application, implementing various features, and ensuring a seamless user experience.
The Moments project had several ideas and functionalities similar to what I envisioned for Fit&Fine, which helped streamline my development process.

## ReadMe Structure
- **TribeHub React Project**: The structure and format of the ReadMe file were inspired by the [TribeHub React](https://github.com/andy-guttridge/tribehub_react) project. The detailed and organized presentation of information in their ReadMe served as a great example for documenting Fit&Fine.
-  My own Project4 **Software Stacks Walkthrough Project**: I utilized the [Software Stacks P4](https://github.com/SwathiKeshavamurthy/SoftwareStacks-P4) repository as a foundational guide. This project provided valuable insights into structuring the application, implementing various features, and ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Technical Solutions
- **React Toastify Messages**: The implementation of Toastify messages for user notifications was inspired by the [Book Worms](https://book-worms-761406c409e0.herokuapp.com/) project. The effective use of Toastify in their application guided me in providing immediate feedback to users in Fit&Fine.

## Personal Thanks
- Many thanks to **my husband** for his incredible support and encouragement throughout this journey.
- My heartfelt gratitude to **my son**, who is 18 months old, for bringing joy and motivation into my life.
- Thanks to **Kristyna, Cohort facilitator** at Code Institute, for always being there to provide all the information needed and for keeping the positive energy up.
- Thanks to  my Code Institute **mentor** and my **fellow students** for constantly inspiring me on Slack and being there for each other to help in times of trouble.
