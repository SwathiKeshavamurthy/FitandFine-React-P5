## Agile Methodologies - Project Management

Fit&Fine utilizes Agile project management to ensure iterative development and continuous improvement. GitHub Projects is used to manage tasks and track progress using a Kanban-style board.

### Story Points Allocation

**Story Points Distribution:**
Story points were allocated to each user story to measure the effort and complexity involved. These points aid in estimating the workload and prioritizing tasks effectively.

**Allocation Guidelines:**
- **Must-have Stories**: Essential features critical to the project's operations were assigned the highest priority.
- **Should-have Stories**: Important but non-essential features that enhance the user experience without being crucial to core functionality. The total story points for "Should-have" stories did not exceed 60% of the total points in any sprint.
- **Could-have Stories**: Desired features considered only after completing the "Must-have" and "Should-have" categories.

### Sprint Planning 

#### Allocating Story Points to Milestones
We need to distribute the 380 story points across the milestones, ensuring they fit within 6 weeks. We will adjust the story points to match the 6-week timeline.

**Milestone 1: Project Setup and Initial Framework**
- **Total Story Points:** 40 (completed in the first week)
- **Breakdown:**
  - **Must-have:** 24 points
  - **Should-have:** 16 points

**Milestone 2: Core Backend APIs**
- **Total Story Points:** 60 (completed in the first and second weeks)
- **Breakdown:**
  - **Must-have:** 36 points
  - **Should-have:** 24 points

**Milestone 3: Basic User Interface and Functionality**
- **Total Story Points:** 100 (completed in the second and third weeks)
- **Breakdown:**
  - **Must-have:** 60 points
  - **Should-have:** 40 points

**Milestone 4: Advanced Features and Final Integration**
- **Total Story Points:** 130 (completed in the third, fourth, and fifth weeks)
- **Breakdown:**
  - **Must-have:** 52 points
  - **Should-have:** 65 points
  - **Could-have:** 13 points

**Milestone 5: Testing and Bug Fixes**
- **Total Story Points:** 50 (completed in the fifth and sixth weeks)
- **Breakdown:**
  - **Must-have:** 20 points
  - **Should-have:** 25 points
  - **Could-have:** 5 points

### MoSCoW Prioritization

To effectively manage project scope, Fit&Fine implements the MoSCoW prioritization method:

- **Must Haves**: Core functionalities including user registration/login, posting fitness updates, and participating in challenges.
- **Should Haves**: Enhanced features like profile customization, dynamic navigation updates, and filtering challenges.
- **Could Haves**: Additional functionalities such as modifying or deleting comments and creating comprehensive documentation.
- **Won't Haves**: Features not essential for the initial launch, such as third-party advertising.
