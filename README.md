## Agile Methodologies - Project Management

Fit&Fine utilizes Agile project management to ensure iterative development and continuous improvement. GitHub Projects is used to manage tasks and track progress using a Kanban-style board.

### Story Points Allocation

**Story Points Distribution:**
Story points were allocated to each user story to measure the effort and complexity involved. These points aid in estimating the workload and prioritizing tasks effectively.

**Allocation Guidelines:**
- **Must-have Stories**: Essential features critical to the project's operations were assigned the highest priority.
- **Should-have Stories**: Important but non-essential features that enhance the user experience without being crucial to core functionality. The total story points for "Should-have" stories did not exceed 60% of the total points in any sprint.
- **Could-have Stories**: Desired features considered only after completing the "Must-have" and "Should-have" categories.

### Sprint Planning 

#### Allocating Story Points to Milestones
We need to distribute the 380 story points across the milestones, ensuring they fit within 6 weeks. We will adjust the story points to match the 6-week timeline.

**Milestone 1: Project Setup and Initial Framework**
- **Total Story Points:** 40 (completed in the first week)
- **Breakdown:**
  - **Must-have:** 24 points
  - **Should-have:** 16 points

**Milestone 2: Core Backend APIs**
- **Total Story Points:** 60 (completed in the first and second weeks)
- **Breakdown:**
  - **Must-have:** 36 points
  - **Should-have:** 24 points

**Milestone 3: Basic User Interface and Functionality**
- **Total Story Points:** 100 (completed in the second and third weeks)
- **Breakdown:**
  - **Must-have:** 60 points
  - **Should-have:** 40 points

**Milestone 4: Advanced Features and Final Integration**
- **Total Story Points:** 130 (completed in the third, fourth, and fifth weeks)
- **Breakdown:**
  - **Must-have:** 52 points
  - **Should-have:** 65 points
  - **Could-have:** 13 points

**Milestone 5: Testing and Bug Fixes**
- **Total Story Points:** 50 (completed in the fifth and sixth weeks)
- **Breakdown:**
  - **Must-have:** 20 points
  - **Should-have:** 25 points
  - **Could-have:** 5 points

### MoSCoW Prioritization

To effectively manage project scope, Fit&Fine implements the MoSCoW prioritization method:

- **Must Haves**: Core functionalities including user registration/login, posting fitness updates, and participating in challenges.
- **Should Haves**: Enhanced features like profile customization, dynamic navigation updates, and filtering challenges.
- **Could Haves**: Additional functionalities such as modifying or deleting comments and creating comprehensive documentation.
- **Won't Haves**: Features not essential for the initial launch, such as third-party advertising.

## Database Schema - Entity Relationship Diagram

I've used [dbdiagram](https://dbdiagram.io/home) to design my site's ERD.

### Database Schema

The Fit&Fine application is structured on a robust database schema designed to facilitate the efficient organization and retrieval of data. Below is an overview of the database schema and the relationships between the different entities.

### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) represents the database schema of Fit&Fine, detailing the system's tables, the data fields within them, and the relationships between the tables.

![ERD of Fit&Fine](documentation/screenshots/erd.png)

### Tables Overview

- **User**: Stores information about the users of the platform, including username, email, and password. The `is_superuser` field indicates whether a user has administrative privileges.

- **Profile**: Contains extended user information such as name, profile image, join date, and other personal details. This table extends the `User` table by associating profiles with user accounts.

- **Challenge**: Central to the application, the `Challenge` table holds data about fitness challenges including title, description, start and end dates, sport type, and the challenge creator (owner).

- **ChallengeParticipant**: Keeps track of which users have joined which challenges. Each record links a user to a specific challenge.

- **DailyRoutine**: Stores data related to users' daily fitness routines, including times for wake-up, meals, workouts, and sleep, as well as additional notes about the user's activities for the day.

- **Post**: Stores posts created by users, including the post content, associated media, creation date, and the user who created the post.

- **Comment**: Enables community interaction by storing comments made by users on posts. Each comment is linked to a specific post and user.

- **Like**: Records likes given by users to posts, tracking which user liked which post.

- **Follower**: Tracks the relationships between users, allowing one user to follow another.

- **About**: Stores static information about the application, such as the company's background, mission statement, and contact details.

- **Collaborate**: Stores user inquiries or messages submitted through the platform's contact form.

### Relationships

- A **one-to-many** relationship exists between `User` and `Challenge`, where one user (as a superuser) can create many challenges.
- A **many-to-many** relationship exists between `User` and `Challenge` through the `ChallengeParticipant` table, allowing multiple users to join multiple challenges.
- A **one-to-many** relationship is set between `Challenge` and `ChallengeParticipant`, where one challenge can have many participants.
- A **one-to-many** relationship exists between `User` and `DailyRoutine`, where one user can have many daily routines.
- A **one-to-many** relationship exists between `User` and `Post`, where one user can create many posts.
- A **one-to-many** relationship exists between `Post` and `Comment`, where one post can have many comments.
- A **one-to-many** relationship exists between `User` and `Comment`, where one user can create many comments.
- A **one-to-many** relationship exists between `Post` and `Like`, where one post can have many likes.
- A **one-to-many** relationship exists between `User` and `Like`, where one user can like many posts.
- A **one-to-many** relationship exists between `User` and `Follower`, where one user can follow many users.
- A **one-to-one** relationship exists between `User` and `Profile`, where each user has one profile.

### Design Considerations

The schema was designed with scalability in mind, ensuring that as the platform grows, new features and data types can be easily incorporated. For example, the separation of the `User` and `Profile` tables allows for flexible user management and the possibility to include additional user attributes in the future without altering the core user authentication system.

## Security

Security is a critical aspect, especially for a platform like Fit&Fine that handles user-generated content and personal data.

### Data Encryption
- All sensitive data, including user passwords and personal information, are encrypted using robust encryption methods to protect against unauthorized access and breaches.

### CSRF Tokens
- CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tokens are included in every form to help authenticate the request with the server when the form is submitted. The absence of these tokens can leave a site vulnerable to attackers who may steal user data.

### Django AllAuth
- Django AllAuth is an installable framework that handles the user registration and authentication process. Authentication is essential to determine when a user is registered or unregistered and to control what content is accessible on Fit&Fine.

### API Security
- The backend uses Django REST framework (DRF) for building the API, with token-based authentication to ensure secure access to the API endpoints.
- Only authenticated users can perform actions like creating posts, joining challenges, and updating profiles.
- Superuser permissions are required for actions like creating, editing, or deleting challenges.
