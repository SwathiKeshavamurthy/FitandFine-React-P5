## Validation 

To ensure the reliability, usability, and accessibility of Fit&Fine, various validation methodologies were implemented. These validations ensure that the application not only meets development standards but also provides a seamless user experience across different platforms and browsers. Below is an overview of the validation processes:

### HTML Validation
- **Tool Used:** [HTML W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
- **Purpose:** Validates the HTML code of the application to ensure it is free from syntax errors and adheres to the standards set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
- **Process:** All HTML pages of Fit&Fine are checked through the W3C validator to identify and fix any markup errors or warnings.
- Validatuion results with zero errors and warnings in **index.html**.

### CSS Validation
- **Tool Used:** [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- **Purpose:** Ensures the CSS code is compliant with W3C standards, free from syntax errors, and follows best practices for styling.
- **Process:** All CSS files are validated through the W3C CSS Validation Service to identify and rectify any issues.

![CSS Validation Screenshot](documentation/validation/css.JPG)

**There were '0' errors and '0' warnings on all other module.css files, except few warnings in index.css and App.module.css which are explained below.**

**CSS Warnings**
This project includes custom styles that make use of vendor-specific extensions and pseudo-elements to ensure a consistent and polished user experience across various browsers and operating systems. During the linting process, certain warnings may appear, indicating the use of these vendor-specific extensions. These warnings are expected and can be safely ignored.

The following vendor-specific extensions and pseudo-elements are used in the project:

1. **Font and Font Smoothing:**
   - `-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,'Segoe UI','Roboto','Oxygen','Ubuntu','Cantarell','Fira Sans','Droid Sans','Helvetica Neue',sans-serif`
   - `-webkit-font-smoothing`
   - `-moz-osx-font-smoothing`

2. **Custom Scrollbar Styles for WebKit Browsers:**
   - `::-webkit-scrollbar`
   - `::-webkit-scrollbar-track`
   - `::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb`

These styles are essential for ensuring optimal font rendering and custom scrollbar appearance, particularly in WebKit-based browsers (such as Chrome and Safari).

### JavaScript Validation

#### ESLint

**Tool Used:** [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

**Purpose:** To detect errors and potential problems in the JavaScript code, ensuring that all scripts run efficiently and are error-free. ESLint helps enforce consistent coding styles and best practices by identifying and fixing problematic patterns in JavaScript code.

**Process:** JavaScript code is run through ESLint to identify issues related to syntax, deprecated methods, and other inefficiencies. The validation steps include running `npm test`, `npx eslint .`, and `npm run lint`.

#### Steps to Run JavaScript Validation

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure all required packages are installed by running:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run ESLint:**
   To run ESLint across the project and identify any issues, use:
   ```sh
   npx eslint .
   ```

   ![JS Validation Screenshot](documentation/validation/esnoerror.JPG)

3. **Run Lint Script:**
   To run the lint script defined in `package.json`, use:
   ```sh
   npm run lint
   ```

   ![JS Validation Screenshot](documentation/validation/lintnoerror.JPG)

4. **Run Tests:**
   To ensure all tests are passing and there are no issues with the codebase, run:
   ```sh
   npm test
   ```
   ![JS Validation Screenshot](documentation/validation/test.JPG)

#### Prettier for Code Formatting

To maintain a consistent code style across the project, Prettier is used to automatically format code. Run the following command to format all code files:

```sh
npm run format
```

## Bugs

### Solved Bugs

1. **Incorrect Display of Joined Date**
   - **Issue:** The joined date for challenges was incorrectly displayed or not formatted properly.
   - **Solution:** Implemented proper date formatting using `toLocaleDateString` to ensure the joined date was displayed in "dd-mm-yyyy" format.
   - **Reference:** [JavaScript Date toLocaleDateString Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleDateString)

2. **Navigation Bar Toggle Issue on Mobile Devices**
   - **Issue:** The navigation bar toggle was not working correctly on some mobile devices.
   - **Solution:** Updated the React Bootstrap NavBar component to ensure the toggle functioned properly across all screen sizes.
   - **Reference:** [React Bootstrap NavBar Documentation](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/docs/components/navbar)

3. **Dynamic Filtering of Challenges**
   - **Issue:** Filtering challenges by sport was not dynamically updating the displayed list.
   - **Solution:** Implemented state management using React hooks to ensure the filtered list updated correctly based on user selection.
   - **Reference:** [React Hooks Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)

4. **Form Submission Validation for Daily Routines**
   - **Issue:** Users were able to submit daily routines with future dates and unrealistic water intake values.
   - **Solution:** Added custom validation in the Django serializers to ensure dates were not in the future and water intake was within a realistic range.
   - **Reference:** [Django Serializers Documentation](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers/)

5. **Image Upload Errors**
   - **Issue:** Users encountered errors when uploading images, especially when the images exceeded the maximum file size.
   - **Solution:** Integrated file size validation and compression before uploading images to Cloudinary, and provided user feedback on file size issues.
   - **Reference:** [Cloudinary Documentation on Image Uploads](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_upload_api)

6. **Navigation Bar Update Issues**
   - **Issue:** The navigation bar did not update dynamically to reflect the user's authentication status.
   - **Solution:** Utilized React's context API to manage global state, ensuring the navigation bar updates in real-time when the user's authentication status changes.
   - **Reference:** [React Context API Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)

7. **Challenges Filtering by Sport**
   - **Issue:** Users were unable to filter challenges by specific sports effectively.
   - **Solution:** Added filter functionality to the challenges API and implemented corresponding frontend filters to allow users to select and view challenges based on specific sports.
   - **Reference:** [Django QuerySet API](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/querysets/)
  
8. **Improving Button Layout**

   - **Issue:** Buttons on the Challenges page were overlapping, making them difficult to interact with.
   - **Solution:** Updated the CSS styles to ensure buttons are spaced properly and do not overlap.
   - **Reference:** [CSS Flexbox Documentation](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

### Known Bugs

1. **Add Post Page Responsiveness**
   - The Add Post page does not appear responsive on some devices.

2. **Intermittent Login Issues**
   - Some users experience intermittent issues while logging in, where the login button becomes unresponsive.
